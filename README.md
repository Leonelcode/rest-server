### Getting started

First things first, you'll need to fork or clone this repository, and run the install command of your choosing (preferrably Yarn):

```
yarn install

// or

npm install
```
And that's really about it (see, I said it was simple!). To fire up the server and have it do stuff, you'll need to start it with the familiar command:

```
yarn start

// or

npm start
```
